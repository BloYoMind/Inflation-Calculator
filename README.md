# Inflation Calculator
This is an open source python inflation calculator
Download the python file and run the command:
*pip install pandas*
This is the only library you will need. The inflation data is already added, and it goes back to the year 1800. I will update it to the next year each december.
The Data from 1800 to 1912 is an approximate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. You can find the data here:
